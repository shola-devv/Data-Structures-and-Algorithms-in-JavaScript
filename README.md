# Data-structures-and-algorithms-in-JavaScript
Covers data structures and algorithms for JavaScripters, noticed only few resources covers this, so I decided to make one myself.
- pseudocode  is written with JavaScript syntax and a mix of English Language 
- check out the readmes before you start out with other folder contents.
- written with simplicity cause I'm kinda dumb

### Runtimes youll see in this repo 👇🏼

### Working with typescript 
- ill try to add translations to typescript when I'm done with JavaScript, for now I'll advise you use an llm as guide for translation to typescript
